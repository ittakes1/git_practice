# Markdown語言

github支援Markdown語言

Markdown語言裡，用分行符號，最後顯示不會產生斷行，必須用空白行分開

## 表格表示

pipe | 用於分開存儲格，直線

dash - 用於分開標題列，橫線，三個以上

Colons : 用於欄位對齊 
```

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
